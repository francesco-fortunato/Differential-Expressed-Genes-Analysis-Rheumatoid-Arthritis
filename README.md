# Differential Expression Genes (DEGs) Analysis in Rheumatoid Arthritis

This repository presents the results of a differential expression analysis of genes in the context of Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). The analysis was conducted as part of the Bioinformatics course led by Professor Giulia Fiscon during the Academic Year 2022/23 at Sapienza University, during the Master's in Engineering in Computer Science.

## Objective

The main objective of this analysis was to identify genes that exhibit differential expression in patients with rheumatoid arthritis compared to healthy individuals. By detecting these differentially expressed genes, we aimed to gain insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of RA and potentially identify novel targets for therapeutic interventions.

## Methodology

The analysis was performed on publicly available gene expression GEOQuery dataset [GSE93272](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE93272) related to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Differential expression analysis was carried out using the R language along with appropriate statistical methods to compare the expression levels of genes between RA samples and healthy controls. The significance of differential expression was determined based on statistical metrics such as p-values, fold changes, and adjusted p-values.
It was also conducted a Principal Component Analysis, a Functional Enrichment Analysis and a miRNA analysis. Finally, a Literature-based research was carried on. All of the details can be found in this [document](https://github.com/francesco-fortunato/Differential-Expressed-Genes-Analysis-Rheumatoid-Arthritis/blob/main/doc/Bioinformatics_Fortunato_Francesco_1848527.pdf).

## Results

The analysis revealed a set of genes that exhibited significant differential expression in the context of rheumatoid arthritis. These genes were found to be associated with various biological processes and pathways relevant to RA pathogenesis, including immune system regulation, inflammation and so on.

## Conclusions

The results obtained are coherent with actual literature. By understanding the dysregulated genes and their associated pathways, researchers can develop a deeper understanding of the disease and potentially identify novel therapeutic targets. The identification of differentially expressed genes can help for further research and targeted investigations for understanding the mechanisms driving the pathogenesis of RA to improve the diagnosis, treatment, and management of RA, benefiting patients. Of course, further research is required to fully understand the specific contributions and interactions of these Genes within the complex network of RA pathogenesis.
